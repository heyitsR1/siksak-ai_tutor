# SikSak - AI Tutor 

### Intro and Background 

<p> ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini are great for gettting stuff done, but I feel like there's a gap in the market. AI that's specifically optimised for boosting your productivity without sacrificing your ability to think critically. </p>

<p> I am building SikSak to address this gap that I have felt. I juggle between multiple AI chatbots and agentic environments, and while they are great at getting things done and finding out about information, I dont' retain these information in the long term. Siksak aims to solve that </p>

> Here's how: 
- First, the role: SikSak is optimized to be a mentor, not an assistant, not an all-knowing deity. 
- It'll have memories of you, that'll be used to personalize your sessions. Current chatbots have this but I can see much more potential that what's currently being utilized. 
- It'll have <i> learning-optimized </i> tools that makes SikSak agentic
- I have special sauce for learners (trust me, how A students prepared before AI)
