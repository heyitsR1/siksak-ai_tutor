## AI Tutor Lite

### Intro and Plans

Basic Requirements: AI chatbot optimized for learning. What does that mean? 
- It doesn't simply give you an answer, forces you to think 
- Remembers how well you know about a topic, and bases answers on that
- has tools it can call  (generate quiz, explore resources, cheatsheet, roadmap)

### MVP ( Minimum Viable Product)

- A chatbot you can talk to 
- Must answer like a teacher would, nudging you with hints instead of full answers
- Remembers your details
- Has at least one tool it can call? Maybe Quizz
